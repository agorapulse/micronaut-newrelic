Micronaut NewRelic library provides `NewRelicInsightsService` bean with two simple methods `createEvent`
and `createEvents`:

[source,java,subs='verbatim,attributes']
----
newRelicInsightsService.createEvent(NewRelicInsightsEvent.create("TestEvent", "key", 10));
newRelicInsightsService.createEvents(Arrays.asList(
    new MyEvent().withKey("key").withValue(20),
    NewRelicInsightsEvent.create("TestEvent", "key", 10)
));
----

The events can be of any class which is annotated with `@Introspected`.
In that case the event type will be same as the name of the events' class
e.g. `MyEvent`.

The events can optionally implement `NewRelicInsightsEvent` interface
which let you fine tune the `eventType` and `timestamp` properties.
