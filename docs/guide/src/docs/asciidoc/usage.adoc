Micronaut NewRelic library provides the `NewRelicInsightsService` bean with two methods, `createEvent` and `createEvents`:

[source,java,subs='verbatim,attributes']
----
newRelicInsightsService.createEvent(NewRelicInsightsEvent.create("TestEvent", "key", 10));
newRelicInsightsService.createEvents(Arrays.asList(
    new MyEvent().withKey("key").withValue(20),
    NewRelicInsightsEvent.create("TestEvent", "key", 10)
));
----

Events can be instances of any class annotated with `@Introspected`.
In that case the event type will be same as the name of the event class,
e.g., `MyEvent`.

WARNING: If you use the library in a non-Micronaut environment (e.g., Grails), ensure your `@Introspected` classes are processed by `micronaut-inject-java` or `micronaut-inject-groovy`.

The events can optionally implement the `NewRelicInsightsEvent` interface,
which let you fine-tune the `eventType` and `timestamp` properties.
